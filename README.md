**about the project**

fdrtd is a modern framework for secure distributed computing:

- [x] cryptography is offloaded to the server/cloud (separation of concerns)
- [x] client-side business logic is simple to implement (no barriers to entry)
- [x] based on lean microservices (no complex monolithic universality)
- [x] runs virtually anywhere (compatibility and interoperability)
- [x] open to 3rd party protocols and vendors (free OpenAPI 3.0 standard)
